# hello-world
Enthusiast and lover of data sets and coding. (First data set on College Recruitment Strategy across different countries)
Ikem here really new to this (coding) bumped into it while taking Biostatistics class and just knew medical school wasn't for me.
So thats it now I'm doing this for real.
